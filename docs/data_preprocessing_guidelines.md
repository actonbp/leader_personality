# Data Preprocessing Guidelines for CEO Speech Analysis

## Current Data Processing Pipeline

Our current standardization process:
1. Cleans and normalizes text (punctuation, capitalization)
2. Removes Q&A artifacts and speaker indicators
3. Structures text into coherent paragraphs
4. Preserves natural speech patterns while removing transcription artifacts
5. Maintains complete context of each speech

## Considerations for Future Data Collection

### 1. Text Volume and Balance
- **Current Range**: 414 to 3,346 words per CEO
- **Recommendations**:
  - Collect multiple speeches per CEO
  - Track word count variations
  - Note when speeches are particularly short or long
  - Document reasons for length variations (e.g., brief media statement vs. full earnings call)

### 2. Speech Contexts
- **Current Context**: Primarily earnings calls
- **Future Collection Should Include**:
  - Earnings calls and quarterly updates
  - Conference keynotes and presentations
  - Media interviews and press conferences
  - Internal company communications
  - Industry event speeches
  - Impromptu vs. prepared remarks
- **Context Metadata**:
  - Tag each speech with its context
  - Note level of preparation (scripted vs. spontaneous)
  - Record audience type and size

### 3. Temporal Considerations
- **Track Time-Based Factors**:
  - Date and time of speech
  - Market conditions at time of speech
  - Company performance period
  - CEO tenure at time of speech
  - Major events or crises
- **Longitudinal Analysis**:
  - Track changes in speech patterns over time
  - Note significant company or industry events
  - Consider seasonal patterns (e.g., quarterly reports)

### 4. Industry Context
- **Current Sample**: Diverse industries (tech, finance, retail, healthcare)
- **Considerations**:
  - Industry-specific terminology
  - Regulatory requirements affecting communication
  - Market position and competition
  - Company size and scale
- **Recommendations**:
  - Tag industry-specific terms
  - Note regulatory constraints
  - Track market capitalization and company metrics

### 5. Speech Characteristics
- **Track and Tag**:
  - Speaking venue and format
  - Audience size and type
  - Use of prepared materials
  - Q&A portions vs. prepared remarks
  - Interactive elements
  - Technical difficulties or interruptions

### 6. Demographic and Background Factors
- **Current**: Good gender representation
- **Additional Factors to Track**:
  - CEO tenure
  - Prior experience
  - Educational background
  - International experience
  - Native language
  - Age group

## Technical Processing Considerations

### 1. Text Chunking Strategy
- **Current**: 2-3 sentences per paragraph, preserving context
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Implement sliding windows for analysis
  - Preserve cross-chunk context
  - Track topic continuity
  - Note transition points

### 2. Cleaning and Standardization
- **Current Process**:
  - Removes transcription artifacts
  - Standardizes punctuation and formatting
  - Preserves natural speech patterns
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Industry-specific term normalization
  - Consistent handling of numbers and dates
  - Better acronym handling
  - Multi-language support considerations

### 3. Metadata Tracking
- **Current**: Basic speech context and word counts
- **Enhanced Tracking**:
  - Speech duration
  - Speaking pace
  - Interruptions and pauses
  - Audience interaction
  - Media coverage
  - Market reaction
  - Company performance metrics

## Quality Control Measures

### 1. Validation Checks
- Verify transcription accuracy
- Check for context preservation
- Ensure proper sentence splitting
- Validate metadata completeness
- Review industry-specific term handling

### 2. Consistency Measures
- Regular expression pattern validation
- Standardized cleaning rules
- Consistent metadata formatting
- Version control for processing scripts
- Documentation of exceptions

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Track processing time
- Monitor text loss during cleaning
- Validate chunk sizes
- Check for information preservation
- Assess model performance on different text lengths
