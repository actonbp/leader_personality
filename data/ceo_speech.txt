Jane Fraser\
Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with who is Citi. Citi is I'm delighted to say finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients cross-border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set out on a deliberate path to get there. And over the last three years, we've done so. Page four is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses. No more, no less. We have our organization now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver and that you and our investors have the transparency need to hold us accountable. So why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there have been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long-term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions, and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model. We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model. And frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen we've moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort and it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves at the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we put in, that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was capitalized by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation from well governed data from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through a client organization. We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy to lead wealth, and we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So we are doing things the right way. We're doing it for the long-term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize '24 is a critical year. And as I said, the decks are much clearer now so that we can focus on two imperatives, improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get, we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so and we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing, and I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done, we will. Mark, expenses?\
Jane Fraser\
Yeah. And I'll jump in. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year, up 19%, ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. And in terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth from '21 to '23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had a high single-digit. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped, and we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases. And that's going to come from a few different areas. One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes. You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I point to our confidence here 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win-loss ratio of 82% on new deals. And that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products, and we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done, Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities. So we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason. And then just quickly on security services, I think, where we're seeing, we mentioned we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers, and one of the core strategies that open put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We had a very low -- we were at 2.6% share in 2020. We're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming not only from our global network names but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. And I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities and that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients. Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I know this business.\
Jane Fraser\
Yeah, I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multiyear journey as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits for the shareholders and more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are separate our transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is productive and as effective as possible. And the types of benefits we're seeing, this is second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base.\
And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms onto one, six reporting ledgers on to one, 11 sanction platforms onto one. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in. Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business.\
We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories that will also begin to start having some benefits for us. So there is a cumulative effect. It is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it is a few years out, but we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going. So, it's not just a trust us, this is coming, you'll begin to see it build.\
Jane Fraser\
Hi. It's Jane. Obviously, I want to just jump in on one bit, which is, we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, and so there isn't any backing away from that number, and that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there is a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you.\
Jane Fraser\
The short answer is no. We have -- if you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses each of which are around $4 billion or so in size. You have our Global FX network where we're typically number one in any year just given the strength and particularly the corporate client base we set off. Rates, typically top three, together these are two of the largest macro pools within fixed. In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified scaled spreads product business.\
And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances, we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum, and we are a leading equities derivatives franchise. So, you do have these four core businesses and I go back to our big point of differentiation and why we still we feel we're well-positioned. We have a very differentiated corporate client base, and a very strong partnership between our core markets franchise, TTS, and banking, and that -- and security services, and that helps us in FX and commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important, both in terms of its leadership but also how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simplicity of those five core interconnected businesses. We demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future and you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting onto RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target we set at Investor Day, we're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of non-strategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency, and we've also been doing some good investments in our technology and it's getting us into a good place there. So I think don't be concerned about the shrinking, we're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns.\
Jane Fraser\
Yeah, well, we've also got areas which are growing. So that does help to see -- we have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this.\
Jane Fraser\
Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because it -- given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly. And with the NPL, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended and we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business, the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So we're going to wait and see before -- where that comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well.\
Jane Fraser\
Yeah. And actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark because I would have thought there's a question that is on everybody's mind, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers is this quarter about the -- what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina. So the bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to you on specifics on the Russia front. If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So that means we hold long-term capital in those countries upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And if we just point to our leading services and FX businesses are the heart of that network and they're generating double-digits, as you can see. With that footprint comes a set of risks. So I think in terms of credit currency transferability of capital. And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years. I'd say Russia is rather unique. It's a wall and for us, a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against, and I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute because I'm sure folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced our emerging market exposures to just our institutional presence focused on the multinational clients. You've heard us talk about that and select high-grade local clients. Look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impact of Q4, we had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over 10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We were able to partially, but not fully hedge the exposure, but we will certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve is a reserve, it centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking rules. So I just want to put part of the things of this quarter into that context, we have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high-grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and a reserve profile. Mark, what would you add?\
Jane Fraser\
Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment at the end of '23 interest rate spreads and volatility at most of the year, equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in '24, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it is very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward, and we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this. And when we're looking at our own side, as you know, we've been investing in some higher growth areas. So we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in health care and technology as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM, the beginnings of one in 11. And so cautiously optimistic here. I'm not -- so I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add?\
Jane Fraser\
Okay. No, we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification. So the 5,000-or-so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators. And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward. So I think what we're looking at here is it getting a bit of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I'd like to see the opposite actually.\
Jane Fraser\
Let me just -- so let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said, we're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate saves from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase III, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. So it was about 13%. And these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier. Then when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, I mean, the stranded costs will be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestures, we'll be continuing, and you've seen it been doing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that. We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right-size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you will begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then we've got other areas where we'll be creating more utilities. We've got -- still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification as highlighted we'll be aggregating those, creating utilities or consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to beginning to get benefits from the transformation where there will be efficiencies that come through. We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments, it's going to be expense growth still in the top -- from volume growth that we've got, and we will be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12% RoTCE target we talked about. So that 20,000 is -- it's the number that we estimate at the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount and I'm thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense saves that we're expecting to achieve in the medium term, and these are the raft of different areas that we will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it.\
