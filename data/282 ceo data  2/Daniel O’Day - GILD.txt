Daniel Oâ€™Day
Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

Thanks, Tyler. Welcome. Let's have Andy start, please. Thanks.

Great. Thanks, Salveen. This is Dan. Maybe I'll start and then ask others to add, but appreciate the question. I think just to reinforce our M&A strategy, I mean, nothing has changed from a business development perspective. And particularly, that's against the context of the background of nearly doubling our clinical trials underway over the past four years, multiple late stage results. As you know, we're expecting more than 20 results still this year and against the backdrop of no significant patent expirations in our business until early parts of the next decade. So I think we'll continue to be opportunistic about pursuing business development in the three areas that we are focused on, which is obviously Virology, Oncology, and Inflammation. We'll be driven by the science. We continue to articulate that building our late research, early development pipeline is probably one of our biggest focuses and we'll continue to look at later stage deals as they fit into our portfolio and our range. It might also be important to note that we are back to pre-immunomatics levels now relative to our leverage ratios. And so we're comfortable with our ability to put capital to work. But nothing has changed and we feel we have everything within Gilead right now to achieve our ambitions over the second half of this decade.

Thank you, Leon. So we've got Cindy Perettie here to handle that. Thanks.

All right. I think Andy is going to take this one.
