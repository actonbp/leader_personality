First, we'll have Samit to answer and then go to Adam.

Thanks for the question, Chris. Maybe I'll just start very quickly and then I'll turn it over to Adam. As we had mentioned, not going to be providing individual product-level guidance, and I think we had alluded to that when we met at JPMorgan three weeks ago. But we did give, and we'll continue to give company line item guidance, as we did today. And then you'll see, as we report it today, we're going to be talking additionally about the growth portfolio that we have, which is going to be important as we think about the business going forward. Adam, do you want to talk about the new launches?

Adam?

Adam?

Adam?

Yeah. Thanks for the question. I'll take that. So, as it relates to IRA, we do expect an improvement in patient affordability as the patient out-of-pocket changes for patients this year and into next. We'll see this more acutely next year as out of pocket max is capped at $2,000 and then the patients have 0% liability thereafter. More broadly, though, we largely don't expect Medicare Part D design changes to impact our portfolio because that'll largely take effect in 2026 when branded Revlimid will be fully eroded.

As it relates to commercial spillover, I think it's important -- we always look at multiple planning scenarios, including the risk of spillover, but also the potential opportunity, as I just shared, around patient affordability. So there are pushes and pulls there with changes in the benefit design. We are going to have to continue to manage potential spillover risk to commercial with the transparency of the MFP price on September 1.

But we also do that today as we manage both books of business. And we'll need to continue to remain disciplined across our commercial payers. And at the same time, just because a payer wants to include this in negotiating mix in commercial, it certainly doesn't mean that we have to agree there. So we expect continued strong performance this year for Eliquis in the U.S. and expect significant growth through the end of 2025.
