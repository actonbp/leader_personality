John Owen
Discover Financial Services (DFS) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

This is John Owen. I'll take part of that, and John Greene will take the capital part. What I would tell you is over the last 18 months or so, weâ€™ve made significant progress improving our risk management and compliance capabilities. We've increased our investments on risk and compliance in 2022 to 2023 up to about a $500 million level.

And as John mentioned earlier, we think expense growth, and that will be in the mid-single digits in line with other guidance we've given. We've made improvements in risk and compliance, but we still have quite a bit of work to do. One thing I'd point out, the FDIC consent order, which we did get and was made public, it does not include the misclassification issue in that scope of work. We're working closely with our regulators on that topic and really don't have anything further to add on that topic at this point in time.
