Icahn Enterprises L.P. (IEP) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript

We don’t really look at it on a 12 month basis, I would just say longer term. If you look at the company, if you look at its margins and you compare it to its peers, we think there’s a lot more upset. And so Dave is the person to lead that effort. And so that’s why he’s there. He’s excited about it and so are we.

So last year you had the deconsolidation that required a lot of effort, and this year is about focusing on Pep Boys’ business and the years to come.

Yes. So I think it’s down a little bit of probably another 5% from what it was in 9/30. Maybe another question you asked on there, which is we continue to refine the portfolio, so we trimmed a few names. And we’re focusing on the names that we like best.

Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today, and we’ll speak to you in a few months.
