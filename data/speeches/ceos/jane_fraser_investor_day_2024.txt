Jane Fraser's Speech at Financial Conference

I'll start with who is Citi. Citi is, I'm delighted to say, finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients' cross-border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set out on a deliberate path to get there, and over the last three years, we've done so.

We are five interconnected businesses. No more, no less. Our organization now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation.
