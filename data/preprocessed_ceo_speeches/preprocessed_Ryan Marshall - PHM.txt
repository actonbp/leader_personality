PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
Carl, so Bob highlighted in the prepared remarks that we - specifically in Q4, October, November were really below expectations, and it was driven by high rates. We had a great December, highest month in the quarter in terms of absolute sales and absorptions per community. So, that was certainly an anomaly for typical December seasonal patterns. And the strength has really continued into January, Carl.
So, weâ€™re feeling pretty good about how the year is starting. In terms of kind of where it sets us up for reduced discounts, increased prices, we're going to watch it closely, and I think we've demonstrated through past behavior that we're always looking to find the sweet spot between pace and price. It won't come as a surprise to you, Carl, that affordability with the buyers remains a challenge. And so, I think we're going to have to be thoughtful about what we do on both the incentive and the price increase front, but we're feeling pretty good about how the year started.
