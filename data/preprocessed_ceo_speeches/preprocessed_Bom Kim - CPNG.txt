Coupang, Inc. (CPNG) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
Hi, Stanley. Thank you for your questions. On our strategy to increase selection and merchant acquisition, the levers that we've been focusing on for growth remain the same. We do see some impact from our selection expansion, but we are expanding margins through improvements in our logistics network and greater utilization of automation, technology, including AI. During 2023, we generated $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA, while increasing margins by 250 bps. Product commerce adjusted EBITDA margin improved nearly 200 bps to 7.1%.
