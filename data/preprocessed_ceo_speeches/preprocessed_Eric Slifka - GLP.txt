Selman, I would say we're going to be opportunistic like we always are. And we'll try to look at every potential deal and every transaction. And there's a lot going on at the company. There's, Motiva has a few assets, the Motiva assets that are in the Texas market. So, the question is, is can we find the right deals, the right assets to create higher returns by utilizing our asset base?
Hey, Greg. It's Eric. It still is busy. I would say there's going to be a lot of opportunity. The question is, do we think it'll fit us? We've got to be very well aware of any overlaps that may exist, too, and the problems that may create. And so, we'll try to look at everything like we always do. And then if the right deals come up in the right locations with the right assets, we'll try hard to see if we can buy it. And I think that's the same thing that we've done, since really the history of the company, right is acquisitions is key to us. It's key to our growth. And there are plenty of markets that we're still not in. So, there's lots of opportunity out there.
Yes, well I would say our preference, we think the assets that have the most flexibility in terms of how they're accessed have the most value and so if you have assets that are waterborne and have large docks and have ways to get in and out and have good tankage, I mean I think it's the same story for every terminal operator but also access in by rail is important so scale in all these markets is critical to make sure that you really have the best assets that are positioned in the future to provide the most flexibility for their users.
Thanks Gregg.
