Kohl's Corporation (KSS) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
Thanks, Bob. As far as growth goes, we feel very confident about being able to hit our guidance of 0% to plus 2%. 2023 was really a setup year for all the initiatives that we think we'll be able to really take advantage of in 2024. The Sephora thing, you've heard us talk about it a lot. I mean we just feel really, really good about it. And we already have it in 910 stores. We're going to add another 140 small formats. We're already stating that we're going to beat our goal in 2025. So that's going to keep on giving us some plus sales.
