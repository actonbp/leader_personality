Sonic Automotive, Inc. (SAH) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript
Good morning, Joe.
Thank you.
We can hear you.
I mean a lot of us -- this is David. We've talked a lot about it, right? There was sort of a window of uncertainty that we saw that really impacted our traffic. And I think that the overall macroeconomic, landscape that people were hesitated a little bit there to do business, and then it came back in, in, in some areas at the close of the year. But I think that was -- again, this is sort of a macro point of saying, hey, we'll just wait and back, let's see, let's see if this storm clears a little bit before we, we going back or that's some of the feedback we've gotten.
That's, that's not something we built into it. Is it an additional store closures?
And as -- this is David. As I mentioned in our opening comments, you're talking about our diversified business model and being able to weather the storm. We view it in jokingly here in the office talk about, it's like in the movie Forrest Gump, when they survived the storm, you've seen these other stores -- these other competitors closing. It's not as if the used vehicle market has just been disintegrated forever. It's not -- we think it's going to be stronger there. It's a much larger market than the new vehicle market historically. And we just -- as we said, we see a tremendous opportunity for EchoPark in the future.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for participating in the call, and we look forward to speaking with you our next quarter. Thank you.
