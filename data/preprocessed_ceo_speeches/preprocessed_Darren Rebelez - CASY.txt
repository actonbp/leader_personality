Yes, Karen, this is Darren, and thank you. Yes, I'll go ahead and start and let Steve fill in some of the detail. Yes, we expect to see a bit of recovery in overall inside margin and we would see that primarily in prepared foods and we think that's for a couple of reasons. We're expecting the inflationary pressure that we've experienced over the last year and a half to settle down a bit. We're currently experiencing some favorability on cheese costs as an example, which as you know is a big input to our prepared food and dispensed beverage margin. So that we expect to continue to improve throughout the year.
